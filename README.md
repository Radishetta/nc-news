# Nutcracker News API

Welcome to my first backend project. It handles API requests to a database with a similar structure to a news website, where the client can create, update or delete some of the content.

This project is part of my journey in the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering.

## Working with this project locally

To be able to work with this project locally:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create the .env.test and .env.development files.
3. For each file we add PGDATABASE="db_name" // with the right atabase in each file: "nc_news_test" or "nc_news"
